1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

I would run it in Github Actions. The reason is that it running it manually may limited it to one certain environment, which may not work for others. Running tests after all development delays the development process.

2) No. I may use a unit test to check one certain function's output. E2E tests usually check user interaction and the functionality of the entire project

3) No, it may not be able to check the overall functionality of messaging(which has many parts).

4) Yes. This is one individual part of the code and can be tested easily by a unit test.
